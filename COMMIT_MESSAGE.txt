CT23D v0.2.0 - Major Feature Release

Major Features:

Enhanced Preprocessing:
- Interactive object selection tools (Box, Lasso, Click-to-select with hover highlighting)
- Automatic bed/headrest detection with configurable aggressivity and parameters
- Image rotation (90° CW, 90° CCW, 180°) with preview before processing
- Remove non-grayscale pixels with configurable saturation threshold
- Selected objects management table with optional labels and individual deletion
- Phase-aware progress tracking (Loading, Processing, Saving) with cancellation support

Enhanced Meshing & Export:
- 3D histogram visualization (X: Slice number, Y: Intensity, Z: Pixel count as heatmap)
- Interactive bin management: add/delete bins, modify min/max values, draggable boundaries
- Continuous bins mode for automatic adjacent bin adjustment
- Slice preview with bin coloring and slice navigation
- PLY export with per-vertex RGB colors and alpha channel (opacity)
- Single file (combined) or multiple files (one per bin) export options
- Format capabilities system (PLY implemented, ready for future formats)
- Default directory linking: preprocessing output automatically set as meshing input

Technical Improvements:
- Simplified mask propagation (same coordinates across all slices)
- Phase-aware progress callbacks throughout the pipeline
- Integer intensity values (0-255) throughout interface and filenames
- Improved UI responsiveness with proper threading and error handling
- New modules: export.py, histogram_3d_view.py, slice_preview.py

Breaking Changes:
- Bin intensity values are now integers (0-255) instead of floats
- Export replaces "Generate meshes" button with inline export options
- Histogram visualization changed from 2D to 3D heatmap representation

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed histogram gap issues by including zero-intensity pixels
- Fixed bin label positioning and display
- Fixed color modification in bin table
- Fixed preview loading and slice navigation
- Fixed progress bar reset and phase tracking
- Fixed cancellation handling in preprocessing

Documentation:
- Updated README with comprehensive feature descriptions and workflows
